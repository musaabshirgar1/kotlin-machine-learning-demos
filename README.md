# Showcases of Different ML Algorithms

### Using Background Color Classification

This is a Kotlin application forked from (kotlin-machine-learning-demos)[https://github.com/thomasnield/kotlin-machine-learning-demos] that experiments with different neural network algorithms to recommend a light/dark font against different background colors. 

Some algorithms are built completely from scratch but others are showcased using a library. 

The current algorithms/library implementations: 

- Formulaic
- Neural Network (w/ hill climbing)
- Neural Network (w/ simulated annealing)
- OjAlgo Neural Network 
- DL4J Neural Network
